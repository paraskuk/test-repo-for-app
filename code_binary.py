Binary search is not the appropriate algorithm for calculating the mean of a list. It's a search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. 

Calculating the mean of a list is a simple operation that won't benefit from binary search optimization. It involves summing all of the elements in the list and then dividing by the count of items in the list. Here's a simple Python function that calculates the mean of a given list.

```python
def calculate_mean(lst):
    return sum(lst) / len(lst)
```
You can provide a large list of numbers as the argument when calling the function.

If your data is truly enormous and cannot fit into memory, you may want to consider using a generator or another method of stream processing to calculate the mean. For example:

```python
def calculate_mean(gen):
    total = 0
    count = 0

    for num in gen:
        total += num
        count += 1

    return total / count
```

In the second function, `gen` should be a generator or iterable that yields your data set one item at a time, allowing the function to process one item at a time rather than loading the entire data set into memory at once.
