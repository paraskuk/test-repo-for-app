Sure, here's a simple function in Python that adds two numbers.

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

To call this function, you'd use `add_two_numbers(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` would be the two numbers you want to add. For example,

```python
result = add_two_numbers(5, 7)
print(result)  # Outputs: 12
```
