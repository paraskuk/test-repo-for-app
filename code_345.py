Sure, here's an example of a Python function that takes in two numbers and performs several sophisticated operations:

```python
def sophisticated_calculation(num1, num2):
    # Addition
    addition = num1 + num2
    print(f"The result of addition: {addition}")
      
    # Subtraction
    subtraction = num1 - num2
    print(f"The result of subtraction: {subtraction}")
      
    # Multiplication
    multiplication = num1 * num2
    print(f"The result of multiplication: {multiplication}")

    if num2 != 0:
        # Division
        division = num1 / num2
        print(f"The result of division: {division} ")

        # Modulus
        modulus = num1 % num2
        print(f"The result of modulus: {modulus}")

        # Power
        power = num1 ** num2
        print(f"The result of power: {power}")
    else:
        print("Num2 is zero, so we can't perform division or modulus.")

    # Square root
    square_root1 = num1 ** 0.5
    square_root2 = num2 ** 0.5
    print(f"The square root of num1 is: {square_root1}")
    print(f"The square root of num2 is: {square_root2}")

sophisticated_calculation(16, 4)
```
This function takes in two inputs, num1 and num2, and performs operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, and square root based on these inputs. Be aware that division and modulus operations are undefined when the second number is zero.

User Level Estimation: The user's programing expertise level isn't completely clear from the query. However, the usage of the term "sophisticated methods" may suggest that the user has at least an intermediate level of understanding in programming. They are aware of functions, passing arguments, and advanced programming concepts but the query is still rather broad and not entirely clear, possibly indicating a lack of advanced knowledge. So, we can assume the user has an intermediate level of programming expertise.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of the user's previous query is neutral.
